This is a program I created for the neuropsychological testing facility I work at. It has a tkinker gui that allows the receptionist to ask the potential patient important information to help with efficiency. 
Afterward, it generates a .docx file to allow us to print it out. This helps the doctors in the office navigate the important information about the patient without needing to decipher messy handwriting. 

This program is actively used in the office. - May 2024

The GUI will auto populate the date that it is opened. For our office, I have also implemented a footer that says: "Appointment date: _______", so that we know when we scheduled the person.

When you go to save the document, it will ask you where you want to save the file. (In our office, we save it to our NAS so that any computer on our network can access it.)

As of May 2024, there is no way to load the .docx file into the generated GUI. If we need to make edits, we do so afterward in Word or Google Docs.
